# CSS Challenges

- Fonts and Colours (Challenge 1): This challenge focused on colouring the text and headings on the website. Internal coding was created into the html file.
- Challenge 2: Proceeded with all code provided and edited where needed. The challanged mainly focused on links, borders, side bars and hovering. A backgound colour with a gradient was selected to give it a elegant feel.
- Challenge 3:
- Float Box Challenge (Challenge 4): By contructing individual boxes and floating some left and right I learned to create and divide sections. This challenge also helped me to hover over certain boxes with different properties.
